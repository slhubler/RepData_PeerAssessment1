# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
#### Constants
```{r}
DATA_FILE = "..\\..\\Data\\activity.csv"
```

#### Load
```{r load}
dta = read.csv(DATA_FILE)
```
#### Process (No changes...yet)


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r steps_evaluation}
with(dta,hist(steps))
mean_steps = mean(dta$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps = median(dta$steps,na.rm = TRUE)
```
The number of Steps is highly skewed towards 0, 
with a **median of `r median_steps`** and **mean of `r mean_steps`**

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
